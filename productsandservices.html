    <h3><b>Labrador</b></h3>
                    <p><img src="images/labrador.jpg" alt="labrador" width="286" height="150" float="left"/></p><p> The labrador is a strongly built, medium-sized,
                    short-coupled, dog possessing a sound, athletic, well-balanced conformation that enables it to function as a retrieving gun dog; the subsatnce
                    and soundness to hunt waterfowl or upland game for long hours under difficult conditions; the character and quality to win in the show ring; and the
                    temperament to be a family companion.</p>
                    
                    
    <h3><b>Rottweiler</b></h3>
                        <p><img src="images/rottweiler.jpg" alt="rottweiler" width="286" height="150" float="left"/></p><p> The ideal Rottweiler is a medium large,
                        robust and powerful dog, black with clearly defined rust markings. His compact and substantial build denotes great strength, agility and endurance.
                        Dogs are characteristically more massive throughout with larger frame and heavier bone than bitches.</p>
                    
                    
    <h3><b>German shepherd</b></h3>
                        <p><img src="images/germanshepherd.jpg" alt="german shepherd" width="286" height="150" float="left"/></p><p> The first impression of a good German shepherd
                        Dog is that of a strong, agile, well-muscled animal, alert and full of life. It is well balanced, with harmonious development of the forequarter and
                        hindquarter. The dog is longer than tall, deep-bodied and presents an outline of smooth curves rather than angles. It looks substantial and not spindly,
                        giving the impression, both at rest and in motion, of muscular fitness and nimbleness without any look of clumsiness or soft living.</p>
                    
    <h3><b>Pit-Bull</b></h3>
                        <p><img src="images/pitbull.jpg" alt="pit-bull" width="286" height="150" float="left"/></p><p> The Pit-bull immediately strikes one as being a dog of power,
                        passion and undying willingness. The bricklike head, which is especially broad between the cheeks (to house its powerful jaws), is carried upon a thickly
                        muscled, well defined neck. The eyes are round and a colour is acceptable. The teeth should form a sciisors bite. Its coat is made up of thick short tiny
                        hair. All colours are admissible. The tail tapers to a point.</p>
                 
    <h3><b>Doberman</b></h3>
                     <p><img src="images/doberman.jpg" alt="doberman" width="286"  height="150"  float="left"/></p><p> With its uncluttered look and symmetrical
                     outline, the Doberman is uniquely a product of the 20th century. Its short shiny coat, clipped ears and tail, superb structure and iron
                     musculature, give the Doberman a trim appearance modern as tomorrow. Outwardly simple, but inwardly complex, it is a mixture of many breeds,
                     combining the fire and lightning reactions of the terrier with the power and intelligence of the guard and herding breeds. The Doberman was
                     tailored for use in police and military work, and to be a medium sized protector-companion in the home.</p>
                
    <h3><b>Bullmastiff</b></h3>
                     <p><img src="images/bullmastiff.jpg" alt="bullmastiff" width="286" height="150" float="left"/></p><p> This breed is known for its Physical
                     strength, protection instincts, courageousness and extreme family loyalty. If an intruder crosses its path, a Bullmastiff will typically
                      use its strength to knock them over or block their path. The breed is very docile in a family environment, however, and makes a great household
                      pet. Good on commands, short hair for easier grooming, the Bullmastiff proves that good things come in small packages. For a person that needs
                      the best guard dogs to make less of an appearance until the time is right, the Bullmastiff is your dog.</p></div>
